# Helps developers define and maintain consistent coding styles between
# different editors and IDEs. The EditorConfig project consists of a file
# format for defining coding styles and a collection of text editor
# plugins that enable editors to read the file format and adhere to
# defined styles. EditorConfig files are easily readable and they work
# nicely with version control systems.
